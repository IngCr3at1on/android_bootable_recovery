### Android Bootable Recovery directory
* This is clockworkmod based (loosely) recovery with touch controls written by Napstar and DooMLoRD.
* The reboot wrappers have been specifically configured for use with the Kindle Fire (originally configured by DooMLoRD) (they are only active for the Kindle so porting to a different device should be easy as screen configs.

### Please note:
* While this is based off of the gingerbread branch it requires the system/extras repo from Jellybean.
